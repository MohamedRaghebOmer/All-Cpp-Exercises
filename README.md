# All-Cpp-Exercises

Welcome to the **Cpp Exercises** master repository! This is a comprehensive collection of all my C++ projects, exercises, and practice materials, organized to reflect my continuous learning journey.

This repository serves as a **unified container** for multiple standalone C++ course repositories, integrated as Git submodules. It is **constantly updated** with new exercises, solutions, and improvements.

## 🚀 About This Repository

The goal of this repo is to keep all my C++ training and problem-solving history in one place while maintaining the independence of each course.

* **Comprehensive Collection:** Includes all levels of C++ exercises, from fundamentals to advanced topics.
* **Structured Learning:** Each submodule represents a specific course or a milestone, primarily following the curriculum of **Eng. Mohamed Abu Hadhoud**.
* **Always Growing:** This repo is live! I regularly add new submodules and update existing ones as I progress through new challenges.
* **Detailed Documentation:** Every exercise within the submodules contains its own code and a README explaining the problem and the logic used.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This is a "Meta-Repository" that links to various course submodules. Each submodule maintains its own version history and specific documentation.

### Included Content

* **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Implementation of various algorithms and logic-building tasks.
* **Advanced Concepts:** OOP, memory management, and specialized C++ libraries.
* **Unique Problems:** Every folder within a submodule focuses on a unique programming challenge to avoid repetition and maximize learning.

## 🛠️ How to Clone (With All Exercises)

Since this repository uses Git submodules, you need to use the `--recurse-submodules` flag to download everything at once:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MohamedRaghebOmer/Cpp-Exercises.git

```

### Keeping the Repository Up-to-Date

To pull the latest exercises added to any of the submodules, run:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge

```

## 💻 Development Environment

All exercises are developed and tested using:

* **IDE:** Visual Studio Community 2026.
* **Standard:** C++14 / C++17 (or newer depending on the exercise).
* **Organization:** Folders are named with a numeric prefix (e.g., `01_ProblemName`) for easy navigation.

---

## 📝 Coding Standards & Style

* **Clarity First:** Code is written to be readable and educational.
* **Documentation:** Every solution includes a brief explanation of the approach and complexity.
* **Consistent Naming:** Meaningful variable and function names.
